# QuickAdminPanel testing

Just a small project for testing and playing with QAP projects

Changes made:

- UsersTableSeeder: changed insert to create
- Added 2 more users (user role and customer role)
- Created Customer role with less permissions (a customer shoulnd't be able to add products for example)
- Default password for the 2 new accounts is P@ssw0rd
